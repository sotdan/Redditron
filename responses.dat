aS'Feminism is inherently sexist, despite the dictionary definition. The word itself implies that wanting gender equality is someone how feminine trait... which is sexist in itself.'

p173
aS"The thing about history is that it's in the past. Clinging to the word 'feminism' is harmful."
p174
aS"Feminism has never been about equality. It's about receiving more benefits without consequence. Even since the suffragettes, who wanted the right to vote without the need to fight for the country. People who want equality no matter religion, race, sex or caste are humanists."

aS"Oh and feminism, 'We are threatened by young women who we call 'children', who gain sexual power and are more promiscuous than us older women.'"
p176
aS"When guys dislike, or have a bad attitude about feminism, it's usually because they're mistaking misandry with feminism... or have met misandrists who self indentify as feminists. The term equalist is something more and more of us indentify with these days."

aS"It's not even really about equality or anything of the sort anymore. It's about giving themselves a sense of identity and a feeling of common purpose. They're no better than the KKK or crackheads.
