p163
aS'Feminism is inherently sexist, despite the dictionary definition. The word itself implies that wanting gender equality is someone how feminine trait... which is sexist in itself.'
p164
aS"The problem is that the name of that movement sort of reinforces that very ignorant idea that equality is just about bringing women up to the status of men, and sort of neglects (again, not the movement itself, I really just mean the word 'feminist') to mention that sexism occurs on both sides in today's society."
p165
aS"The thing about history is that it's in the past. Clinging to the word 'feminism' is harmful."
p166

aS"Oh and feminism, 'We are threatened by young women who we call 'children', who gain sexual power and are more promiscuous than us older women.'"
p168
aS"When guys dislike, or have a bad attitude about feminism, it's usually because they're mistaking misandry with feminism... or have met misandrists who self indentify as feminists. The term equalist is something more and more of us indentify with these days."

aVMost MRAs are just normal people who don't want to see their sons and loved ones disadvantaged by unfair, sexually biased laws and the social conditioning that affects all of us.
p1035
aVIt's simple. We're anti-feminist because feminism is anti-male. Same reason that black activists are anti-KKK.
p1036
aVThe MRM is very gay-friendly, and trans-friendly. We fight for the rights of all men, whether they be straight, gay, white, black, brown, red, yellow, purple, trans or cis.

aS"The simple fact that morons like Adrian over here are trying to somehow link child pornography to Men's Rights, shows how downright terrified these feminist-fascists are of us. This effectively shows that we're truly becoming a movement, and I must say I'm excited for the future :)"
